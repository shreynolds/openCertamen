# openCertamen
This program creates teams for Open Certamen at JCL conventions. The goal is for people from the same school to not be on the same team.

In the future, I hope to have the program assign rooms for each team.

## Instructions
Clone the current repository. Create a Google Form and put the link in your program for students to fill out.
Once the sign up period has finished, download the data as a csv, rename the file responses.csv, and rename the columns "Name","Level", "School". Move the csv to the same folder as the python file.
Next, go to the code and change the classroom names, if desired.
Run the code in terminal using python3. You should have an HTML output with the teams.
